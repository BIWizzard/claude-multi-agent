# Progressive Development Checklist

## Pre-Development Planning

### Strategic Decomposition
- [ ] **Define Complex Goal**: Clear statement of what you want to build
- [ ] **Use Decomposition Prompt**: "Help me break this task down into 4-5 manageable tasks, so that we can build incrementally and each one is independently testable"
- [ ] **Validate Component List**: Each component should be buildable and testable independently
- [ ] **Identify Dependencies**: Clear understanding of which components depend on others
- [ ] **Plan Integration Points**: Know how components will connect

### Foundation Planning
- [ ] **Identify Core Utility**: What's the simplest possible working version?
- [ ] **Define Success Criteria**: How will you know the foundation works?
- [ ] **Plan Test Scenarios**: What will you test first?
- [ ] **Avoid Feature Creep**: Resist adding "just one more thing" to the foundation

## Development Execution

### Stage 1: Foundation Building
- [ ] **Use Foundation Prompt**: "Let's start with just creating a simple [utility] that can [basic function]. Let's keep it simple."
- [ ] **Build Minimal Version**: Focus on one core function only
- [ ] **Create Test Content**: Build test scenarios before complex features
- [ ] **Test Immediately**: Run tests and verify actual output
- [ ] **Document Results**: Capture what works and what doesn't

### Stage 2: Incremental Addition
For each new feature:
- [ ] **Reference Previous Work**: "Based on our experience with [previous feature]..."
- [ ] **Add One Feature**: Build only one new capability at a time
- [ ] **Test Integration**: Ensure new feature works with existing components
- [ ] **Verify Output**: Request actual test results, not assumptions
- [ ] **Handle Edge Cases**: Ask "What happens if..." for failure scenarios

### Stage 3: Progressive Testing
- [ ] **Test Each Component**: Individual functionality verification
- [ ] **Test Integration**: Components working together
- [ ] **Test Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary scenarios
- [ ] **Performance Testing**: Speed, memory usage, scalability
- [ ] **User Experience Testing**: Ease of use and error messages

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Verification
- [ ] **Request Output**: "Run the test and show me the output"
- [ ] **Distinguish Reality from Expectation**: "Was that summary the result of running the test, or just expected behavior?"
- [ ] **Verify Edge Cases**: Test missing files, invalid input, boundary conditions
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Measure actual improvements (e.g., cache performance)

### Communication Patterns
- [ ] **Use Specific Prompts**: "Test this with 5 files" vs "Test multi-file support"
- [ ] **Request Demonstrations**: "Show me what each role sees versus what they don't see"
- [ ] **Incremental Requests**: "Now add [feature]" vs "Build complete system"
- [ ] **Context References**: "Based on our experience building [X], now let's..."

## Integration and Completion

### System Integration
- [ ] **Unified API**: "Combine all pieces into one [ClassName] that can [functionality]. Keep the interface simple."
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Full workflow demonstration
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful failure with user-friendly messages
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Caching, efficiency improvements
- [ ] **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

### Final Validation
- [ ] **Complete Workflow Test**: End-to-end functionality demonstration
- [ ] **Multi-Scenario Testing**: Different use cases and user types
- [ ] **Production Readiness**: Error handling, performance, documentation
- [ ] **User Experience**: Non-technical users can understand and use
- [ ] **Extensibility**: Architecture supports future enhancements

## Success Metrics

### Component Level
- [ ] ✅ Feature works in isolation
- [ ] ✅ Test cases pass consistently
- [ ] ✅ Error handling covers edge cases
- [ ] ✅ Performance meets requirements

### Integration Level
- [ ] ✅ Components work together seamlessly
- [ ] ✅ No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] ✅ User interface remains simple
- [ ] ✅ Documentation covers all use cases

### System Level
- [ ] ✅ Meets original complex requirements
- [ ] ✅ Production-ready code quality
- [ ] ✅ User-friendly documentation
- [ ] ✅ Extensible architecture

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### During Planning
- [ ] ❌ Don't try to build everything at once
- [ ] ❌ Don't skip the decomposition step
- [ ] ❌ Don't assume complex requirements from the start

### During Development
- [ ] ❌ Don't build without testing
- [ ] ❌ Don't assume behavior without verification
- [ ] ❌ Don't skip edge case testing
- [ ] ❌ Don't add multiple features simultaneously

### During Integration
- [ ] ❌ Don't integrate all components at once
- [ ] ❌ Don't skip regression testing
- [ ] ❌ Don't ignore user experience
- [ ] ❌ Don't leave documentation for the end

## Effective Prompting Templates

### Decomposition
```
"I want to build [complex system]. Before we code anything, help me break this task down into four or five manageable tasks, so that we can build incrementally and each one is independently testable."
```

### Foundation Building
```
"Let's start with just creating a simple [utility] that can [basic function]. Let's keep it simple. And we'll add functionality once that's complete."
```

### Testing Verification
```
"Show me how to test this with a simple example."
"Run the test and show me the output."
"I want to perform [specific test scenarios] to make sure we get the same behavior and success metrics."
```

### Edge Case Testing
```
"What happens if [edge case scenario]? Show me through test output how the system handles those edge cases."
```

### Progressive Building
```
"Based on our experience building [previous feature], now let's add [specific new feature]."
```

### Integration
```
"Now combine all the pieces into one [ClassName] that can [complete functionality]. Keep the interface simple."
```

### Workflow Demonstration
```
"Create a comprehensive example that shows the full workflow: [step 1], [step 2], [step 3]. Demonstrate that they see different content."
```

## Results Tracking

### Quantitative Metrics
- Performance improvements (e.g., "100% cache hit improvement")
- Efficiency gains (e.g., "80% noise reduction")
- Test coverage (number of scenarios tested)
- Error handling coverage (edge cases handled)

### Qualitative Metrics
- Code maintainability and readability
- User experience and documentation quality
- System extensibility and modularity
- Team collaboration effectiveness

### Learning Capture
- What worked well in this approach?
- What would you do differently next time?
- Which prompting patterns were most effective?
- What edge cases were discovered?
- How can this pattern be improved for future projects?

**Remember**: The goal is not perfection on the first try, but steady progress through incremental building with immediate feedback. Each step should provide clear value and learning that informs the next step.
