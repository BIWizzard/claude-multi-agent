# Module 2: Strategic Scoping & Progressive Development

## Overview

This module documents the proven patterns for breaking down complex multi-agent projects into manageable, testable components. Based on the successful implementation of a context management system in Exercise 1, these patterns enable effective AI-human collaboration through strategic scoping and incremental development.

## Core Philosophy

**Complex systems succeed through simple foundations, not complex beginnings.**

The key insight: Start with the simplest possible working version, test it thoroughly, then build the next layer. Each layer must be independently testable and provide clear value before moving forward.

## The Five-Stage Progressive Development Pattern

### Stage 1: Strategic Decomposition
**Objective**: Break complex goals into independently testable components

**Pattern**: `Complex Goal → Core Components → Testing Strategy → Integration Plan`

**Prompting Framework**:
```
"I want to build [complex system]. Before we code anything, help me break this task down into four or five manageable tasks, so that we can build incrementally and each one is independently testable."
```

**Real Example from Context Management**:
- **Input**: "Build a context management system for multi-agent coding projects"
- **Output**:
  1. Simple file reading utility
  2. Multi-file directory processing
  3. Caching mechanism
  4. Role-based filtering
  5. Unified API with error handling

**Key Success Factors**:
- Each component can be built and tested in isolation
- Clear dependencies between components
- Observable progress at each stage
- Ability to validate assumptions early

### Stage 2: Foundation Building
**Objective**: Create the simplest possible working version

**Pattern**: `Minimal Viable Feature → Test Content → Implementation → Immediate Testing`

**Prompting Framework**:
```
"Let's start with just creating a simple [core utility] that can [basic function]. Let's keep it simple. And we'll add functionality once that's complete."
```

**Real Example**:
- **Prompt**: "Let's start with just creating a simple file reading utility that can ingest a Markdown file, break it down into sections. Let's keep it simple."
- **Result**: Basic markdown parser with section extraction
- **Test**: Single file with various header levels

**Key Success Factors**:
- Focus on one core function
- No premature optimization
- Immediate testability
- Clear success criteria

### Stage 3: Incremental Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Verify each component works before building the next

**Pattern**: `Implementation → Test Creation → Execution → Output Verification → Next Layer`

**Prompting Framework**:
```
"Show me how to test this with a simple example file."
"Run the test and show me the output."
"I want to perform [specific test scenarios] to make sure we get the same behavior and success metrics."
```

**Real Example**:
- **Test Request**: "I want to perform two more independent tests: 1. Test this with five files and make sure we get the same behavior. 2. Test missing file handling with friendly prompts."
- **Result**: Comprehensive validation of multi-file processing and error scenarios

**Key Success Factors**:
- Create test scenarios before implementing complex features
- Use actual output verification, not assumptions
- Test both success and failure cases
- Document test results for future reference

### Stage 4: Progressive Feature Addition
**Objective**: Build complexity gradually on proven foundations

**Pattern**: `Working Base → New Feature → Integration Testing → Validation → Next Feature`

**Prompting Framework**:
```
"Now let's add [specific feature] to the existing system."
"Based on our experience with [previous feature], let's now implement [next feature]."
"Combine all the pieces into one [unified system] that can [complete functionality]."
```

**Real Example Sequence**:
1. Basic file reading → Multi-file support
2. Multi-file support → Caching mechanism
3. Caching → Role-based filtering
4. All features → Unified ContextManager class

**Key Success Factors**:
- Each addition builds on proven functionality
- Integration testing at each step
- Maintain working system throughout development
- Clear rollback points if issues arise

### Stage 5: Comprehensive Integration
**Objective**: Create unified, production-ready system

**Pattern**: `Component Integration → Comprehensive Testing → User Documentation → Production Readiness`

**Prompting Framework**:
```
"Now combine all the pieces into one [SystemName] class that can [complete functionality]. Keep the interface simple."
"Create a comprehensive example that shows the full workflow: [step 1], [step 2], [step 3]. Demonstrate that they see different content."
```

**Real Example**:
- **Integration**: Combined file reading, caching, filtering, and error handling into single ContextManager class
- **Testing**: Full workflow demonstration showing coordinator vs executor views
- **Documentation**: User guides and API documentation

## Specific Prompting Patterns That Work

### 1. Decomposition Prompts
**Purpose**: Break complex problems into manageable pieces

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"Help me break this task down into four or five manageable tasks, so that we can build incrementally and each one is independently testable."

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"How should I build this system?"
```

**Why it works**: Requests specific number of tasks, emphasizes testability and incremental approach.

### 2. Foundation Prompts
**Purpose**: Start with simplest working version

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"Let's start with just creating a simple [utility] that can [basic function]. Let's keep it simple."

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"Build a complete system that handles all use cases."
```

**Why it works**: Explicitly requests simplicity, focuses on single function, prevents over-engineering.

### 3. Testing Verification Prompts
**Purpose**: Ensure actual functionality matches expectations

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"Run the test and show me the output."
"Was that summary the result of running the test, or was that just showing expected behavior?"

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"Does the system work correctly?"
```

**Why it works**: Requests concrete evidence, distinguishes between actual and expected behavior.

### 4. Edge Case Exploration Prompts
**Purpose**: Identify and handle failure scenarios early

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"What happens if a section isn't marked for either role or a section needs to be viewed by both roles? Show me through test output how the system handles those edge cases."

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"Make sure error handling works."
```

**Why it works**: Requests specific scenarios, asks for demonstrated behavior through testing.

### 5. Progressive Building Prompts
**Purpose**: Add complexity gradually to working foundation

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"Based on our experience building [previous feature], now let's add [specific new feature]."

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"Add all the remaining features."
```

**Why it works**: References proven foundation, adds one feature at a time, maintains incremental approach.

### 6. Integration Verification Prompts
**Purpose**: Ensure components work together correctly

```
✅ EFFECTIVE:
"Create a comprehensive example that shows the full workflow: [step 1], [step 2], [step 3]. Demonstrate that they see different content."

❌ INEFFECTIVE:
"Test that everything works together."
```

**Why it works**: Requests specific workflow demonstration, asks for concrete evidence of different behavior.

## Testing Strategy Patterns

### 1. Test-First Development
**Pattern**: Create test scenarios before implementing features

```
Sequence:
1. "Create test content that has data from both sections"
2. "Then demonstrate that it's working"
3. "Show me what each role sees versus what they don't see"
```

### 2. Incremental Validation
**Pattern**: Test each component as it's built

```
Validation Points:
- Single file processing
- Multi-file processing (test with 5 files)
- Error handling (missing files, empty directories)
- Performance (caching effectiveness)
- Integration (full workflow)
```

### 3. Edge Case Testing
**Pattern**: Proactively test failure scenarios

```
Edge Cases to Test:
- Missing files and directories
- Empty or malformed content
- Invalid role assignments
- Mixed content types
- Performance under load
```

## Communication Patterns for Effective Collaboration

### 1. Specific Over General
```
✅ EFFECTIVE: "Test this with five files and make sure we get the same behavior"
❌ VAGUE: "Test multi-file support"
```

### 2. Output Verification
```
✅ EFFECTIVE: "Show me what each role sees versus what they don't see"
❌ VAGUE: "Does filtering work?"
```

### 3. Progressive Requests
```
✅ EFFECTIVE: "Now add caching to the existing file reader"
❌ OVERWHELMING: "Build a complete system with all features"
```

### 4. Context Reference
```
✅ EFFECTIVE: "Based on our experience with [previous work], now let's..."
❌ DISCONNECTED: "Build this new feature"
```

**Solution**: Use foundation prompts to start simple

### 2. Assumption-Based Development
**Problem**: Building without testing actual behavior
**Solution**: Request output verification at each step

### 3. Skipping Edge Cases
**Problem**: Only testing happy path scenarios
**Solution**: Proactively ask for edge case testing

### 4. Complex Integration
**Problem**: Trying to integrate all components at once
**Solution**: Incremental integration with testing at each step

### 5. Poor Communication
**Problem**: Vague requests leading to misaligned results
**Solution**: Use specific prompting patterns with concrete examples

## Template Application

To apply this module to a new project:

1. **Start with decomposition prompt**: Break complex goal into 4-5 testable components
2. **Build foundation**: Implement simplest possible working version
3. **Test immediately**: Create test scenarios and verify actual output
4. **Add incrementally**: Build one layer at a time with testing
5. **Integrate systematically**: Combine components with comprehensive validation
6. **Document thoroughly**: Create user guides and examples

This pattern transforms complex projects into manageable, successful implementations through strategic scoping and progressive development.
