## ðŸŽ¯ **Context for Next Session**

### **What You Were Working On:**
You were completing the final polish phase of migrating the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab from Alpine.js/Vite to Astro framework. The migration includes modern React components, syntax highlighting, and enhanced copy button functionality.

### **Current Priority:**
Finishing typography and spacing enhancements to complete the migration. The Astro version has working syntax highlighting and copy buttons, but needs final polish for optimal user experience.

### **Session Continuity Prompt:**

```
I'm continuing work on the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab Astro migration project. In the previous session, I successfully migrated from Alpine.js/Vite to Astro framework using multi-agent orchestration.

Current status:
- âœ… Framework migrated to Astro + React islands
- âœ… Syntax highlighting working with Shiki
- âœ… Copy buttons implemented with React components
- âœ… Tailwind CSS with typography plugin configured
- ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS: Final typography and spacing polish

Current working directory: /Users/kmgdev/dev_projects/claude-multi-agent/projects/learning-lab-astro/
Dev server: Multiple instances running on http://localhost:4323

The migration uses:
- Astro 5.13.9 with React 19.1.1 islands
- CopyButton.tsx and CodeBlockWithCopy.tsx components
- Enhanced global.css with improved spacing and typography
- Content Collections for structured content management

I was in the middle of enhancing spacing, typography, and overall polish in the global.css file. Please help me continue from here and complete the final polish phase.
