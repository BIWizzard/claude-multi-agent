## üìã Section 5 Starter Prompt

**Copy this exactly into Claude Code:**

```
I'm working through Section 5 of the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab.

**Required documentation structure**: Please follow the standards in `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`:
- Organize files in projects/section-05-coordination/ with src/, docs/, tests/ subdirectories
- Create section README.md following the template format
- Include user-friendly documentation accessible to non-technical users
- Test all functionality and document actual results
- Create section-05-summary.md with pattern extraction
- Contribute Module 3 to the master template at knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md

**Previous context**:
- Section 3: Built AI collaboration skills and context inheritance patterns (Module 1 added to template)
- Section 4: Mastered strategic scoping and progressive development (Module 2 added to template)
- Current template progress: 2/5 modules complete

**This section's goal**: Master advanced multi-agent coordination patterns and agent orchestration techniques

Please help me break down multi-agent coordination systems into manageable, testable components while following the established documentation standards and contributing Module 3 to our master template.
