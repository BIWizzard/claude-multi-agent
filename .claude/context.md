# Multi-Agent Orchestration Mastery Project Context

## Project Mission
Learning laboratory for mastering multi-agent workflows in Claude Code through hands-on exercises and real-world application.

## Current Status
- **Active Exercise**: Exercise 01 - Claude Code Fundamentals
- **Progress**: 5% complete of overall learning objectives
- **Phase**: Setup Complete - Ready for Phase 1 Implementation

## Learning Architecture
### Sequential Learning Path
1. Claude Code Fundamentals → Advanced context management and project structure
2. Basic Multi-Agent → Coordinator-worker patterns and communication
3. Advanced Orchestration → Complex workflows and error handling
4. Tool Integration → External frameworks and production patterns

### Knowledge Extraction Flow
Exercise Implementation → Documented Learnings → Knowledge Base → Production Templates

## Repository Navigation
- **Current Work**: Always in /exercises/[current-exercise]/
- **Context Location**: /exercises/[current-exercise]/.claude/context.md
- **Progress Tracking**: /LEARNING_LOG.md
- **Knowledge Base**: /knowledge-base/ for extracted patterns

## Agent Interaction Principles
1. **Context Isolation**: Each exercise maintains separate Claude Code context
2. **Clean Handoffs**: Update context before agent transitions
3. **Progress Documentation**: Real-time learning capture
4. **Pattern Extraction**: Document reusable patterns after each exercise

## Success Metrics
- Rapid multi-agent project setup (target: <10 minutes)
- Clean agent coordination without context confusion
- Production-ready patterns and templates
- Comprehensive troubleshooting knowledge base

## Current Session Focus
- Setting up Exercise 01: Claude Code Fundamentals
- Establishing context management patterns
- Creating agent isolation architecture
- Preparing for hands-on implementation
