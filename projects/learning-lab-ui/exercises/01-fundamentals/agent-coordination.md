# Advanced AI Collaboration: Multi-Agent Coordination

## 🎯 What You're Mastering

This section advances your AI collaboration skills to **multi-agent scenarios**:
- **Delegation strategies** - How to coordinate multiple AI agents effectively
- **Context boundaries** - Maintaining clear information boundaries between agents
- **Validation workflows** - Testing that agent coordination actually works
- **Meta-collaboration** - Managing the human role in multi-agent systems

## 🧠 The Advanced Challenge

You'll simulate coordinating multiple AI agents (coordinator + executor) using Claude Code. **Focus on your orchestration and validation skills.**

📋 **Section 5 Starter Prompt**

```
I'm working through Section 5 of the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab.

**Required documentation structure**: Please follow the standards in `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`:
- Organize files in projects/section-05-coordination/ with src/, docs/, tests/ subdirectories
- Create section README.md following the template format
- Include user-friendly documentation accessible to non-technical users
- Test all functionality and document actual results
- Create section-05-summary.md with pattern extraction
- Contribute Module 3 to the master template at knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md

**Previous context**:
- Section 3: Built AI collaboration skills and context inheritance patterns (Module 1 added to template)
- Section 4: Mastered strategic scoping and progressive development (Module 2 added to template)
- Current template progress: 2/5 modules complete

**This section's goal**: Master advanced multi-agent coordination patterns and agent orchestration techniques

Please help me break down multi-agent coordination systems into manageable, testable components while following the established documentation standards and contributing Module 3 to our master template.

### **Exercise 5A: Multi-Agent Delegation** (8 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Coordinating multiple AI agents through clear delegation

#### Step 1: Coordinator Setup (3 minutes)
```
I need to simulate a multi-agent workflow. Create a simple TaskCoordinator that can delegate work to different "agent roles" (coordinator vs executor). Each role should receive filtered context and specific instructions. Start with the basic delegation structure.
```

#### Step 2: Test Delegation (2 minutes)
```
Create a scenario where the coordinator assigns a task to an executor with specific context. Show me how the context filtering works - what does each agent see vs what they don't see?
```

#### Step 3: Validation (3 minutes)
```
Now demonstrate that agent isolation is working: if I change the executor's context, does it affect what the coordinator sees? Test this independence.
```

### **Exercise 5B: Workflow Orchestration** (10 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Managing complex workflows with AI assistance

#### Step 1: Multi-Step Workflow (4 minutes)
```
Create a workflow where the coordinator delegates multiple sequential tasks to different executors. Show how context gets passed between agents while maintaining boundaries. Test with a realistic scenario like "build a user authentication system."
```

#### Step 2: Parallel Coordination (3 minutes)
```
Now demonstrate parallel task execution - coordinator assigns independent tasks to multiple executors simultaneously. How do we track progress and coordinate completion?
```

#### Step 3: Error Handling (3 minutes)
```
Test what happens when one agent encounters an error. How should the coordinator respond? Show recovery patterns and graceful degradation.
```

### **Exercise 5C: Template Building - Multi-Agent Delegation Module** (5 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Creating reusable multi-agent coordination patterns

#### Step 1: Delegation Pattern Extraction (2 minutes)
```
Help me create "Module 3: Multi-Agent Delegation & Orchestration" based on our coordination experiments. Document the specific patterns for delegating tasks, maintaining context boundaries, and handling multi-agent workflows.
```

#### Step 2: Template Integration (2 minutes)
```
Update knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md with Module 3. Include the delegation patterns, orchestration strategies, and error handling approaches we discovered.
```

#### Step 3: Real-World Application (1 minute)
```
Show how someone would apply this Multi-Agent Delegation module when building a social media platform with separate agents for frontend, backend, and database work.
```

**🏆 Success**: Your template now handles complex multi-agent coordination!

```javascript
// Initialize coordinator
const coordinator = new TaskCoordinator(__dirname);
await coordinator.initialize('session-002');

// Assign a task
const taskId = coordinator.assignTask({
  name: 'Test agent isolation',
  type: 'validation',
  successCriteria: {
    deliverables: ['isolation-test', 'results']
  }
});

// Simulate task completion
coordinator.receiveResults(taskId, {
  deliverables: {
    'isolation-test': 'Context filtering works correctly',
    'results': 'Agents receive only relevant information'
  },
  validationResults: { allPassed: true }
});

// Generate handoff
const handoff = coordinator.prepareHandoff();
console.log('Handoff prepared:', handoff);
```

## ✅ Validation Checklist

- [ ] Coordinator can assign tasks with appropriate context
- [ ] Executors receive filtered, role-specific information
- [ ] Progress tracking works across multiple tasks
- [ ] Decision logging captures rationale
- [ ] Handoff packages contain complete state
- [ ] No context confusion between agents

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Agent Isolation Test
- Coordinator context includes objectives and progress
- Executor context includes only current task details
- No cross-agent information leakage

### Communication Quality
- Clear task assignments
- Structured result reporting
- Complete handoff packages
- Decision audit trail

## 🚑 Troubleshooting

### "Agents getting wrong context"
**Solution**: Check filtering rules in ContextManager, verify agent name matching

### "Tasks not tracking properly"
**Solution**: Ensure task IDs are unique, check progress update logic

### "Handoffs incomplete"
**Solution**: Verify all required state is captured, check handoff package structure

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

Document:
- How task assignment works
- What context each agent receives
- How progress is tracked
- How handoffs maintain continuity

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By completing this section, you'll understand:
- How to coordinate multiple agents effectively
- The importance of context isolation
- How to maintain state across sessions
- How to design clean agent communication
