# AI Collaboration Skills Training: Your First Claude Code Session

## 🎯 What You're Actually Learning

This isn't about becoming a JavaScript expert - it's about mastering **AI collaboration patterns**:
- **Strategic prompting** - How to give Claude Code effective direction
- **Quality validation** - How to verify and improve AI output
- **Iterative guidance** - How to course-correct when needed
- **Documentation habits** - How to capture patterns for reuse

## 🔄 Transition: Web → Claude Code

Time to practice real AI collaboration! You'll work through **4 focused exercises** that teach you how to effectively direct Claude Code.

## 💻 Setup: Open Claude Code

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd path/to/your/claude-multi-agent
```

### Step 2: Verify Structure
```

📋 **Section 3 Starter Prompt**

```
I'm working through Section 3 of the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab.

**Required documentation structure**: Please follow the standards in `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`:
- Organize files in projects/section-03-ai-collaboration/ with clean structure
- Create user-friendly documentation accessible to non-technical users
- Test all functionality and document actual results
- Contribute Module 1 to the master template at knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md

**This section's goal**: Master fundamental AI collaboration patterns through hands-on practice with context inheritance systems

Please help me practice AI collaboration skills by starting with creating a simple context inheritance system that demonstrates how information flows between different levels (global → project → session) in multi-agent projects.

## 🎓 Exercise Flow: Progressive Skill Building

You'll complete **4 mini-exercises** (5-8 minutes each) that build your collaboration skills:

---

### **Exercise 3A: Context Setting & Initial Prompting** (8 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Writing effective initial prompts

**Your Task**: Create a project workspace with Claude Code

#### Step 1: Initial Prompt (2 minutes)
Tell Claude Code:
```
Create a new directory called 'ai-collaboration-practice' in the projects folder. Inside it, create a simple README.md file that explains this is a practice workspace for learning AI collaboration patterns.
```

#### Step 2: Review & Assess (2 minutes)
- Did Claude create what you expected?
- Is the README helpful or generic?
- What would you improve?

#### Step 3: Iterative Improvement (3 minutes)
Ask Claude to:
```
Update the README to include a section about what makes a good AI collaboration prompt, with 3 specific examples.
```

#### Step 4: Validation (1 minute)
- Does the updated content feel useful?
- Could someone else use this as a reference?

**🏆 Success**: You've practiced prompt clarity and iterative improvement!

---

### **Exercise 3B: Specific Direction & Course Correction** (7 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Giving precise instructions and redirecting when needed

#### Step 1: Specific Request (2 minutes)
```
Create a file called 'context-hierarchy.md' that explains the 3 levels of context (global, project, session) with one example for each level.
```

#### Step 2: Quality Check (2 minutes)
- Are the examples concrete or vague?
- Does the explanation make sense?
- What's missing?

#### Step 3: Course Correction (2 minutes)
```
The examples are too abstract. Please rewrite with specific, real-world examples - like actual file names and content snippets that would exist in each context level.
```

#### Step 4: Pattern Recognition (1 minute)
- Notice how specific feedback gets better results
- What made your second prompt more effective?

**🏆 Success**: You've learned to be specific and redirect effectively!

---

### **Exercise 3C: Testing & Validation with AI** (6 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Using Claude Code to validate its own work

#### Step 1: Implementation Request (2 minutes)
```
Create a simple JavaScript function that demonstrates context inheritance - where a session context inherits from project context, which inherits from global context.
```

#### Step 2: AI-Assisted Testing (2 minutes)
```
Now create a test for that function that demonstrates the inheritance working correctly. Run the test and show me the output.
```

#### Step 3: Understanding Check (2 minutes)
```
Explain what this code teaches about context management patterns. What would happen if we wanted to override a value at the session level?
```

**🏆 Success**: You've used AI to both build and validate solutions!

---

### **Exercise 3D: Documentation & Knowledge Capture** (5 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Capturing collaboration patterns for future use

#### Step 1: Pattern Documentation (2 minutes)
```
Create a file called 'collaboration-patterns.md' that documents the prompting techniques we just used. Include what worked well and what didn't.
```

#### Step 2: Template Creation (2 minutes)
```
Add a template section that someone could copy-paste for their next Claude Code session - include placeholders for project context, specific goals, and validation steps.
```

#### Step 3: Meta-Learning (1 minute)
- Review what you've created
- Could you use these patterns on your next project?

**🏆 Success**: You've documented reusable AI collaboration patterns!
