# Applied AI Collaboration: Building Context Management

## 🎯 What You're Practicing

Now you'll apply your AI collaboration skills to build something real. This section focuses on:
- **Scoped requests** - Breaking complex tasks into manageable pieces
- **Progressive refinement** - Building up functionality step by step
- **Validation techniques** - Ensuring each piece works before moving on
- **Pattern recognition** - Identifying what makes good AI-human collaboration

## 🧠 The Learning Challenge

You'll use the collaboration patterns from Section 3 to guide Claude Code through building a context management system. **Focus on your prompting and guidance skills, not the JavaScript details.**

📋 **Section 4 Starter Prompt**

```
I'm working through Section 4 of the Claude Multi-Agent Learning Lab.

**Required documentation structure**: Please follow the standards in `.claude/DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md`:
- Organize files in projects/section-04-strategic-scoping/ with src/, docs/, tests/ subdirectories
- Create section README.md following the template format
- Include user-friendly documentation accessible to non-technical users
- Test all functionality and document actual results
- Create section-04-summary.md with pattern extraction
- Contribute Module 2 to the master template at knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md

**Previous context**:
- Section 3: Built AI collaboration skills and context inheritance patterns (Module 1 added to template)
- Current template progress: 1/5 modules complete

**This section's goal**: Master strategic scoping and progressive development through building a context management system

Please help me break down context management systems into manageable, testable components following the progressive development approach I learned in Section 3.

### **Exercise 4A: Strategic Planning & Scoping** (8 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Breaking complex requests into manageable pieces

#### Step 1: High-Level Planning (3 minutes)
```
I want to build a context management system for multi-agent projects. Before we code anything, help me break this down into 4-5 discrete, testable pieces that we can build one at a time. Each piece should be something we can validate independently.
```

#### Step 2: Assess the Plan (2 minutes)
- Does the breakdown feel logical?
- Are the pieces too big or too small?
- What would you change?

#### Step 3: Refine Scope (2 minutes)
```
Let's start with just the first piece. Create a simple file-reading utility that can load a markdown file and parse it into sections. Keep it minimal - we'll add features later.
```

#### Step 4: Validation (1 minute)
Ask Claude Code:
```
Show me how to test this utility with a simple example file.
```

**🏆 Success**: You've practiced scoping and planning with AI!

### **Exercise 4B: Iterative Building & Testing** (10 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Progressive development with continuous validation

#### Step 1: Build on Foundation (3 minutes)
```
Now extend the file reader to handle multiple files in a directory. It should be able to load several markdown files and combine their content with a clear structure.
```

#### Step 2: Immediate Testing (2 minutes)
```
Create a test that demonstrates loading 3 different markdown files. Show me the output structure so I can see how it's organized.
```

#### Step 3: Quality Check & Redirect (3 minutes)
Review the output, then:
```
The structure looks good, but I need the system to handle missing files gracefully. Add error handling that gives helpful messages when files don't exist, and test it with a non-existent file.
```

#### Step 4: Progressive Enhancement (2 minutes)
```
Perfect! Now add a simple caching mechanism so we don't re-read files unnecessarily. Make it easy to clear the cache when needed.
```

**🏆 Success**: You've guided incremental development with validation at each step!

---

### **Exercise 4C: Feature-Driven Development** (7 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Adding specific functionality through clear requirements

#### Step 1: Specific Feature Request (2 minutes)
```
Add role-based filtering. I need two filter functions: one that shows only sections marked as 'coordinator-relevant' and another that shows only 'executor-relevant' sections. Use markdown headers or comments to mark sections.
```

#### Step 2: Validation Strategy (2 minutes)
```
Create test content that has both types of sections, then demonstrate the filtering working correctly. Show me what each role sees vs what they don't see.
```

#### Step 3: Edge Case Testing (2 minutes)
```
What happens if a section isn't marked for either role? And what if the same section needs to be visible to both roles? Show me how the system handles these cases.
```

#### Step 4: Documentation (1 minute)
```
Add comments explaining how someone would mark their content for role-based filtering. Make it simple for non-technical users.
```

**🏆 Success**: You've guided feature development with comprehensive testing!

---

### **Exercise 4D: Integration & Collaboration Reflection** (5 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Pulling pieces together and documenting collaboration patterns

#### Step 1: Integration (2 minutes)
```
Now combine all the pieces into one ContextManager class that can load files, cache them, filter by role, and handle errors gracefully. Keep the interface simple.
```

#### Step 2: End-to-End Testing (2 minutes)
```
Create a comprehensive example that shows the full workflow: loading context, filtering for a coordinator, then filtering for an executor, demonstrating that they see different content.
```

#### Step 3: Collaboration Pattern Documentation (1 minute)
```
Create a quick README that documents the collaboration patterns we used: how we broke down the problem, tested incrementally, and built up functionality. What would you tell someone else about effective AI collaboration?
```

**🏆 Success**: You've completed a complex build using structured AI collaboration!

### **Exercise 4E: Template Building - Strategic Scoping Module** (5 minutes)

**🎯 Skill Focus**: Converting learning into reusable prompt templates

#### Step 1: Pattern Extraction (2 minutes)
```
Based on our experience building the context management system, help me create "Module 2: Strategic Scoping & Progressive Development" for our multi-agent project template. Document the specific prompting patterns we used for breaking down complex tasks, testing incrementally, and building progressively.
```

#### Step 2: Template Integration (2 minutes)
```
Add this new module to the template file at knowledge-base/templates/multi-agent-project-setup.md. Replace the placeholder "Module 2" with our actual patterns, including example prompts someone could customize for their own project.
```

#### Step 3: Validation (1 minute)
Ask Claude:
```
Show me how someone would use this Strategic Scoping module when starting a new e-commerce website project. Customize the prompts with realistic details.
```

**🏆 Success**: You've built your professional multi-agent toolkit!
