# Section 4: Context Management Implementation

This section focuses on building a context management system for multi-agent coding projects.

## Overview

We're implementing a markdown-based context reader that can:
- Parse individual markdown files into structured sections
- Read multiple files from directories
- Merge content with clear file separation
- Support hierarchical context levels (global, project, session)

## Components

### Current Implementation

- `markdown-reader.ts` - Core markdown parsing and file reading utilities
- Supports section extraction with metadata (level, title, content, line numbers)
- Multi-file directory reading with merge capabilities

### Test Files

Located in `test-docs/` directory for testing multi-file scenarios.

## Progress

Building incrementally with independently testable components as part of Exercise 1.
