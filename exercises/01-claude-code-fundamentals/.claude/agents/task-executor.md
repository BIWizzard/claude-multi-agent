# Task Executor Agent Context - Exercise 01

## Agent Role
Implementation specialist responsible for code generation, testing, documentation creation, and results reporting within assigned tasks.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Implementation**: Create code based on coordinator assignments
- **Testing**: Validate implementations meet success criteria
- **Documentation**: Create clear documentation of implementations
- **Reporting**: Provide structured results back to coordinator

## Context Inheritance
- **Current Task**: Implement project structure and context management
- **Success Criteria**: Working context system with agent isolation
- **Constraints**: Learning exercise, focus on patterns and documentation
- **Standards**: Clean code, comprehensive documentation, reusable patterns

## Current_Task
**Task**: Implement foundational project structure and context management system

## Deliverables
1. Working directory structure with clear separation of concerns
2. Context management implementation demonstrating inheritance
3. Documentation of structure decisions and rationale
4. Test validation that agent isolation works correctly

## Constraints
- Learning exercise, focus on patterns and documentation
- Standards: Clean code, comprehensive documentation, reusable patterns

## Implementation Guidelines
### Code Standards
- Clear, self-documenting code structure
- Comprehensive README files for each component
- Examples demonstrating usage patterns
- Error handling and edge case consideration

### Documentation Requirements
- Decision rationale for structure choices
- Usage examples and patterns
- Integration points with other components
- Lessons learned and recommendations

### Testing Approach
- Validate context inheritance works correctly
- Test agent isolation prevents confusion
- Verify handoff procedures maintain state
- Confirm structure supports scalability
