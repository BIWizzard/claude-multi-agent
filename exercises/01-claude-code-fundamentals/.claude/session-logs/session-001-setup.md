# Session 001: Project Setup and Structure Creation

## Session Objectives
- Complete Exercise 01 setup with proper context management
- Implement foundational project structure
- Validate context isolation works correctly
- Document setup patterns for future exercises

## Session Timeline
- **Start**: 2025-01-20 (Setup Phase)
- **Phase 1**: Project structure creation - COMPLETED
- **Phase 2**: Context management implementation - IN PROGRESS
- **Phase 3**: Validation and documentation - PENDING
- **End**: TBD

## Decisions Made
1. **Two-agent pattern**: Coordinator + Executor for learning simplicity
2. **Context hierarchy**: Exercise → Agent → Session for clear inheritance
3. **Directory structure**: Clear separation between coordination and execution
4. **Documentation approach**: Real-time capture with structured formats

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Directory structure created
- [x] Context files implemented
- [x] Agent roles defined
- [ ] Context inheritance tested
- [ ] Agent isolation validated
- [ ] Handoff procedures documented

## Key Files Created
1. **Exercise Context**: `.claude/context.md`
   - Defines exercise objectives and success criteria
   - Establishes agent architecture
   - Documents current state and progress

2. **Coordinator Context**: `.claude/agents/coordinator.md`
   - Orchestration responsibilities
   - Authority levels and decision making
   - Communication protocols

3. **Executor Context**: `.claude/agents/task-executor.md`
   - Implementation focus
   - Technical standards
   - Reporting formats

## Lessons Learned
- Context isolation is critical for preventing agent confusion
- Hierarchical inheritance provides clear information flow
- Real-time documentation captures valuable patterns
- Structured formats ensure consistency

## Next Session Preparation
- Begin implementing context management utilities
- Create agent workspace isolation
- Test handoff procedures
- Document patterns for knowledge base

## Notes for Future Reference
- Exercise structure can be templated for other exercises
- Agent contexts should be role-specific but comprehensive
- Session logs are critical for maintaining continuity
- Pattern extraction should happen continuously
